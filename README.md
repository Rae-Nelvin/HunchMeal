## Gameplay

List the key of gameplay of HunchMeal:

-   The user selects a food from a predefined list (hidden from view).

-   The user interacts with a bot to gather clues about the chosen food.

-   Clues can be requested about:

    -   Type (e.g., Main Course, Snack)

    -   Taste (e.g., Spicy, Sweet)

    -   Processing (e.g., Fried, Grilled)

    -   Ingredients (e.g., Meat, Seafood, Vegetables)

-   Each question asked increases a counter.

-   A timer tracks the total time spent guessing.

-   The game session is limited to 5 minutes.

-   The user wins by correctly identifying the food within the time limit and with the least number of questions.
